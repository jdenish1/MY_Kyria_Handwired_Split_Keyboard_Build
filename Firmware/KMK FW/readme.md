Was having a hard time getting QMK to compile so I decided to try KMK FW instead. Before completely getting this working i started fresh with QMK and got it compiled on the default keymap. QMK FW files are more current and up to date so check that folder for current FW Files as well as the .uf2 and .hex files for flashing.

Thanks

Peace
