# MY_Kyria_Handwired_Split_Keyboard_Build
This is my rendition of a handwired split keyboard I did based on the Kyria by Thomas Baard ---> https://blog.splitkb.com/introducing-the-kyria/

This is my first split KB attempt and have been wanting to build a split for a while now. Ive done two other keyboard builds prior. Not only did I get inspiration from the original creator Thomas Baard but also from another github member MoltenZaz linked here ---> https://github.com/MoltenZaz/Handwired-Kyria. I dont know these guys personally but I got inspiration from their builds.

Try out the Keyswitch spacing with Baards printout here ----> https://docs.splitkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010627159-Can-I-try-the-Kyria-before-I-buy?ref=blog.splitkb.com

I added 2 EC11 rotary encoders, one per side, for the bottom left key on left side and bottom right key of right side which added a bit of complexity to the firmware build.

I also added WS2812 RGB Underglow to each side and ditched the 3d printed bottom plate for a handmade clear acrylic bottom plate.

Anyways, just made this public in case it helps anyone else out, in the spirit of the open source movement....

Enjoy
