After finally getting QMK to compile with the DEFAULT keymap, not my personal keymap, now Im trying to get Vial FW to work so I can easily edit keymap on the fly (without having to hold reset button on microcontroller and having to remove the keyboard case back cover) with the Vial Software. 

CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS....
